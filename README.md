Plan: 
- watch videos of clip etc. 
- visualise Flickr30k with notebooks
- set up environment 
- build very modular flow with python 

- build full flow with pytorch functions 
- aim to finish project today... 



# Tues: 

before lunch: 
- Complete model file (and tests)
- start on dataset, define the questions you want to think about (average pooling captions and adding vocabulary)

after lunch: 
- complete dataset file (and tests)
- complete training file (and tests)
- complete evaluate file (and tests)
- complete inference file (do both beam search and greedy decoder)
- actually implement the decoder instead of using the pytorch built-in function 




Wed: 
- Begin extension 




Thurs: 
- Complete extension 





# Fri: 
- Exclusively work on:
    - deploying model to a demo product 
    - generating results and visuals for presentation 
    - slides for presentation
